# nosql-challenge
module 12 challenge
In this challenge I was tasked to evaluate ratings for various food establishments to help the journalists and food critics of the magazine "Eat Safe, Love" decide where to focus future articles. In part 1 there was a json file provided in the resources folder. I used mongo import in my terminal to import the json file to use. After I made sure I created the database and loaded the data properly I then displayed one document and assigned the 'establishments' collection to a variable so it would be ready for future use. In part 2 i needed to make some modifications to the database. I updated the restaurant  "Restaurant/Cafe/Canteen" business type id, I removed all establishments from Dover Local Authority from the database, and I converted strings to numbers. In part 3 I was able to show establishments with specific hygiene scores, ratings, and was able to sort this information into a dataframe with scores highest to lowest.
